I'm currently operating 1 entry relay, 2 exit nodes and 4 bridges.

[Occultum1 - $7D442AD17726CE7C7C72206AADF5445F57AD60D9](https://globe.torproject.org/#/relay/7D442AD17726CE7C7C72206AADF5445F57AD60D9)
[Occultum2 - $B354405C65BAA9A7626461BCAD2A22AE54605A92](https://globe.torproject.org/#/relay/B354405C65BAA9A7626461BCAD2A22AE54605A92)
[Occultum3 - $](https://globe.torproject.org/#/relay/)

My bridges must, of course, remain a secret. That's the whole point of bridges, afterall.
